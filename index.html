        <h1>Upgrade from Angular 13 to Angular 18</h1>

        <!-- Upgrade from Angular 13 to Angular 14 -->
        <h2>13 to 14</h2>
        <p>The first step was upgrading Angular from version 13 to 14. Below are the steps I followed:</p>

        <h3>1. Backup Your Project</h3>
        <p>Before starting the upgrade process, I made sure to back up my entire project. This step is crucial to
            prevent any data loss in case of errors during the upgrade.</p>
        <pre><code>cp -r my-project my-project-backup</code></pre>

        <h3>2. Upgrade Node.js Version</h3>
        <p>To begin, I made sure that Node.js was up-to-date. Angular 14 requires a newer version of Node.js, so I
            updated it to the latest LTS version:</p>
        <pre><code>nvm install --lts</code></pre>

        <h3>3. Check for Outdated Packages</h3>
        <p>I used the <code>npm outdated</code> command to check for outdated packages before upgrading Angular. This
            showed me which packages needed to be updated manually:</p>
        <pre><code>npm outdated</code></pre>

        <h3>4. Manually Upgrade Packages</h3>
        <p>Next, I manually upgraded the following packages to the specific versions that Angular 14 requires:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>@angular/cdk</code></li>
            <li><code>@angular/compiler</code></li>
            <li><code>@angular/core</code></li>
            <li><code>@angular/cli</code></li>
            <li><code>@types/node</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are the commands I used to upgrade them:</p>
        <pre><code>npm install @angular/cdk@14 @angular/compiler@14 @angular/core@14 @angular/cli@14 @types/node@14 --save-dev</code></pre>

        <h3>5. Upgrade TypeScript Version</h3>
        <p>Since Angular 14 required a specific TypeScript version, I upgraded TypeScript to version 4.9 using the
            following command:</p>
        <pre><code>npm install typescript@4.9 --save-dev --legacy-peer-deps</code></pre>

        <h3>6. Update Angular CLI</h3>
        <p>I updated the Angular CLI globally and locally to version 14:</p>
        <pre><code>npm install -g @angular/cli@14</code></pre>
        <pre><code>npm install @angular/cli@14</code></pre>

        <h3>7. Resolve Dependency Issues</h3>
        <p>During the upgrade, I ran into some peer dependency issues. To resolve them, I used the
            <code>--legacy-peer-deps</code> flag. This flag helps resolve peer dependency conflicts by installing
            packages even if the versions are incompatible:</p>
        <pre><code>npm install --legacy-peer-deps</code></pre>

        <h3>8. Clean npm Cache</h3>
        <p>I ran <code>npm cache clean --force</code> to clear the npm cache. This was necessary to prevent issues
            caused by corrupted or outdated cache:</p>
        <pre><code>npm cache clean --force</code></pre>

        <h3>9. Check TypeScript Version</h3>
        <p>Before proceeding, I checked the TypeScript version using the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>npx tsc --version</code></pre>
        <p>This ensured that I was using a compatible TypeScript version before proceeding with the Angular upgrade.</p>

        <h3>10. Run the Project with Increased Memory</h3>
        <p>After upgrading the packages, I encountered memory issues while running the project. To resolve this, I used
            the following command to allocate more memory to the process:</p>
        <p>then I ran the application to check if it worked correctly</p>
        <pre><code>node --max_old_space_size=8192 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve</code></pre>
        <p>This command increases the maximum memory allocation for the Node.js process, preventing out-of-memory errors
            during the build process.</p>

        <!-- Upgrade from Angular 14 to Angular 15 -->
        <h2>14 to 15</h2>
        <p>After committing the progress made from Angular 13 to Angular 14, I started upgrading from Angular 14 to
            Angular 15 as per the Angular update guide.</p>

        <h3>1. Verify Node.js Version</h3>
        <p>Angular v15 supports the following versions of Node.js:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>14.20.x</li>
            <li>16.13.x</li>
            <li>18.10.x</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I checked my current Node.js version using:</p>
        <pre><code>node --version</code></pre>
        <p>I already have Node version <b>v20.12.2</b> so no need to worry.</p>

        <h3>2. Verify TypeScript Version</h3>
        <p>Angular v15 requires TypeScript version 4.8 or later. I verified my TypeScript version with:</p>
        <pre><code>npx tsc --version</code></pre>
        <p>I updated TypeScript to the required version:</p>
        <pre><code>npm install typescript@4.8 --save-dev --legacy-peer-deps</code></pre>

        <h3>3. Run `npm outdated`</h3>
        <p>I ran the <code>npm outdated</code> command to check which packages needed to be updated. The following
            packages required an upgrade:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>@angular/animations@15.2.10</code></li>
            <li><code>@angular/common@15.2.10</code></li>
            <li><code>@angular/compiler@15.2.10</code></li>
            <li><code>@angular/core@15.2.10</code></li>
            <li><code>@angular-devkit/build-angular@15.2.11</code></li>
            <li><code>@angular/cli@15.2.11</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To upgrade them, I used the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>npm install @angular/animations@15.2.10 @angular/common@15.2.10 @angular/compiler@15.2.10 @angular/core@15.2.10 @angular-devkit/build-angular@15.2.11 @angular/cli@15.2.11 --save-dev</code></pre>

        <h3>4. Resolve Google Maps Issue</h3>
        <p>During the upgrade, I encountered a problem with <code>@angular/google-maps</code> as it is no longer
            maintained in Angular 15. I attempted to upgrade the library and check if it still worked, but ultimately I
            had to switch to a different, actively maintained package.</p>
        <p>I upgraded the <code>agm-direction</code> package with:</p>
        <pre><code>npm install agm-direction@latest</code></pre>
        <p>This resolved some issues, but I had to make further changes in upcoming angular versions because this
            library is no longer maintained and supported. <code>@angular/google-maps</code></p>

        <h3>5. Fix `ngx-infinite-scroll` Compatibility</h3>
        <p>I faced compatibility issues with <code>ngx-infinite-scroll</code> during the upgrade. Although I tried
            installing <code>ngx-infinite-scroll@0.5.21</code>, it didn't work. I had to manually update the code in
            several files to make the library compatible with Angular 15.</p>
        <p>After rewriting parts of the code in 2-3 files where <code>ngx-infinite-scroll</code> was used, I
            successfully resolved the issues and got the functionality working again.</p>

        <h3>6. Fix `NaN` Check Issue</h3>
        <p>During the upgrade, I encountered a bug where <code>NaN</code> values were being incorrectly checked. In
            JavaScript and TypeScript, <code>NaN</code> is not equal to itself, so simple equality checks like
            <code>year == NaN</code> don't work as expected.</p>
        <p>The solution was to use <code>Number.isNaN()</code> for checking <code>NaN</code> values:</p>
        <pre><code>
if (Number.isNaN(year) || Number.isNaN(month) || Number.isNaN(day)) {
    return null;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>After updating the code to use <code>Number.isNaN()</code>, the issue was resolved, and the checks for
            invalid numbers (i.e., <code>NaN</code>) worked as expected.</p>

        <h3>7. Test the Changes</h3>
        <p>After completing the upgrade and resolving the issues, I ran the application to ensure everything worked as
            expected:</p>
        <pre><code>node --max_old_space_size=8192 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve</code></pre>
        <p>The application compiled with warnings but without errors, and all the features were working fine.</p>
